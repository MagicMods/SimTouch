# Architecture: Grid (Template - Verified 2024-08-03)

**Purpose:** Definitive state and principles of the `Grid` project, serving as the template for migration.

**Core Principles:**

- **Stateless Components:** Components receive necessary state via method parameters (e.g., `dimensions`, `gridConfig`) rather than relying heavily on internal state set at construction.
- **Clear Dependencies:** Dependencies are managed explicitly (either injected or instantiated internally where appropriate).
- **Decoupled Rendering:** Visual boundary rendering is separated (`boundaryRenderer`), Grid rendering (`gridGenRenderer`).
- **Centralized Configuration:** Master `gridParams` object owned by `Main`.
- **Modern JS:** Uses ES6 classes, modules, `const`/`let`.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Utilizes a singleton `eventBus` provided by `util/eventManager.js` for decoupled communication between components. Components subscribe to events relevant to their function. Key event flows include:
  - `uiControlChanged` (Payload: `{paramPath, value}`): Emitted by UI panels (`newGridUi.js`). Subscribed by `Main` to update the central `gridParams` object.
  - `gridParamsUpdated` (Payload: `{gridParams, dimensions}`): Emitted by `Main` after `gridParams` state is updated (incorporating dimension changes). Subscribed by various components (`UiManager`, `BoundaryManager`, `GridGenRenderer`, `BoundaryRenderer`) to trigger necessary updates based on the new state.

**Key Components & State:**

- **`main.js`:** Entry point. Owns the master `gridParams` object. Creates core managers and renderers. Subscribes to `uiControlChanged` via `eventBus` to receive UI updates. Calls `dimensionManager.checkAndApplyDimensionChanges`. Emits `gridParamsUpdated` via `eventBus` to notify components of state changes.
- **`coreGrid/`:**
  - `dimensionManager.js`: Manages dimensions. Instantiated by `Main`.
  - `boundaryManager.js`: Manages boundaries. Instantiated by `Main`. Subscribes to `gridParamsUpdated`.
  - `gridGeometry.js`: Generates grid cells. Instantiated internally by `GridGenRenderer`.
  - `boundary/`: Shape boundary definitions.
- **`renderer/`:**
  - `gridGenRenderer.js`: Instanced grid renderer. Instantiated by `Main`, receives `dimensionManager`, `boundaryManager`. Subscribes to `gridParamsUpdated`.
  - `baseRenderer.js`: Minimal base class.
  - `boundaryRenderer.js`: DOM-based physics boundary renderer. Instantiated by `Main`, receives `boundaryManager`, `canvas`. Subscribes to `gridParamsUpdated`.
- **`overlays/`:**
  - `overlayManager.js`: Manages DOM overlays. Instantiated internally by `GridGenRenderer`.
- **`simulation/boundary/`:** Physics boundary definitions.
- **`shader/`:** Shader manager and source.
- **`ui/`:**
  - `uiManager.js`: Manages UI panels (e.g., creating `newGridUi`). Subscribes to `gridParamsUpdated` via `eventBus` to update UI elements based on state changes.
  - `panels/newGridUi.js`: Specific UI panel for controlling grid parameters. Emits `uiControlChanged` via `eventBus` when a control value changes.
- **`util/eventManager.js`:** Provides the singleton `eventBus` instance used throughout the application for event-based communication.
