## Execution & Analysis: Phase B - Parameter Consolidation (2024-08-01)

**Objective:** Centralize core physics parameters (`gravity`, `damping`, `timeStep`, `substeps`) into `main.gridParams.physics` and refactor `ParticleSystem` to use them.

**Execution Log:**

1.  **Add Physics Params:** Added `this.gridParams.physics` object with defaults (`gravity: {x:0, y:-0.01}`, `damping: 0.98`, `timeStep: 1.0`, `substeps: 5`) to `Sim/src/main.js`.
2.  **Refactor ParticleSystem Constructor:**
    - Modified `Sim/src/simulation/core/particleSystem.js` constructor to accept a single `params` object.
    - Updated constructor to extract physics parameters from `params.gridParams.physics`.
3.  **Update ParticleSystem Instantiation:**
    - Modified the `new ParticleSystem(...)` call in `Sim/src/main.js` to pass the required components and `gridParams` within a single object.
4.  **Fix Blocker:** Resolved an unrelated initialization error (`OverlayManager` missing `DimensionManager` dependency) that occurred during verification.
5.  **Verification:** Confirmed successful refactoring and application initialization via CHECK+ mode.

**Physics Component Analysis:**

- Reviewed `TurbulenceField`, `VoronoiField`, `EmuForces`, `MouseForces`, `MicInputForces`, and `FluidFLIP`.
- Found that these components either do not directly use the core physics parameters being consolidated or correctly use the `dt` value provided by the `ParticleSystem` during the simulation loop.
- **Conclusion:** No immediate refactoring of these specific components was required for this phase of parameter consolidation.

**Side Effect:** Noted that the default simulation behavior changed due to differences between the old hardcoded defaults in `ParticleSystem` and the new defaults in `main.gridParams.physics` (specifically `gravity` and `timeStep`). Discussed how to adjust `timeStep` in `main.js` to achieve the previous `1/60` effective rate.

**Status:** Phase B, Step 2 (ParticleSystem Parameter Consolidation) is complete. Core physics parameters are now centrally managed and consumed by `ParticleSystem`.

---

## Execution & Analysis: Phase B - FluidFLIP Parameter Consolidation (2024-08-01)

**Objective:** Centralize `FluidFLIP` configuration parameters (`gridSize`, `picFlipRatio`, `iterations`, `overRelaxation`, `restDensity`) into `main.gridParams.fluid`.

**Execution Log:**

1.  **Identify Params:** Read `Sim/src/simulation/core/fluidFLIP.js` constructor.
2.  **Locate Instantiation:** Determined `FluidFLIP` is instantiated within `ParticleSystem` constructor, not `main.js`.
3.  **Update gridParams:** Added `this.gridParams.fluid` object with defaults (`gridSize: 32`, `picFlipRatio: 0`, etc.) to `Sim/src/main.js`.
4.  **Refactor FluidFLIP:** Modified `FluidFLIP` constructor to accept a single `params` object and extract config from `params.gridParams.fluid`.
5.  **Update Instantiation:** Modified `new FluidFLIP(...)` call in `Sim/src/simulation/core/particleSystem.js` to pass the single `params` object (containing `gridParams`) and the effective `dt`.
6.  **Verification:** Completed [CHECK] mode validation, confirming implementation matches the plan.

**Status:** Phase B, `FluidFLIP` Parameter Consolidation is complete. Core fluid parameters are now centrally managed and consumed by `FluidFLIP` via `ParticleSystem`.

**Next Step Analysis:**

- Continue Phase B: Parameter Consolidation.
- **Primary Candidate:** Consolidate the hardcoded `particleRadius` (currently `0.01` in `ParticleSystem.js`) into `gridParams`. Consider placing it under `gridParams.physics` or creating `gridParams.particles`.
- **Secondary Candidates:** Analyze `CollisionSystem` and force field parameters (`TurbulenceField`, `VoronoiField`) for centralization.

## Analysis: Particle Count Parameter (2024-08-01)

**Context:** Investigating the source of `particleCount` in `ParticleSystem` as part of Phase B.

**Findings:**

- `ParticleSystem.js` currently sets `this.particleCount = gridParams?.grid?.target || 500;`.
- `GridGeometry.js` uses `params.grid.target` as the target number of _visual grid cells_ to generate.
- This creates a coupling: changing the target visual cell count also changes the initial simulation particle count.

**Conclusion:**

- The number of visual grid cells and the number of simulation particles are distinct concepts.
- Coupling them via `gridParams.grid.target` is potentially confusing and limits independent control.

**Recommendation:**

- Decouple these by introducing a dedicated parameter for particle count.
- Plan: Add `gridParams.particles.count` in `main.js` and refactor `ParticleSystem` to use it, removing the reliance on `gridParams.grid.target`.

---

## Analysis: CollisionSystem Parameters (2024-08-01)

**Context:** Examining `Sim/src/simulation/forces/collisionSystem.js` for parameter consolidation as part of Phase B.

**Findings:**

- Constructor accepts: `enabled`, `gridSize`, `repulsion`, `damping`, `particleRestitution`, `particleRadius`.
- Identified consolidation candidates:
  - `enabled`: Controls if collisions are active.
  - `gridSize`: Size of internal collision grid.
  - `repulsion`: Strength of overlap push-back.
  - `particleRestitution`: Bounciness.
  - `particleRadius`: Fallback value (primary value should come from `particleSystem` reference, sourced from `gridParams.particles.radius`).
- `damping` is already centrally managed (`gridParams.physics.damping`) and applied in `ParticleSystem`; applying it again here might be redundant or incorrect. Deferred consolidation for `damping`.

**Recommendation:**

- Centralize `enabled`, `gridSize`, `repulsion`, `particleRestitution`, and `particleRadius` into a new `gridParams.collision` object.
- Refactor `CollisionSystem` to source these parameters from `gridParams` passed via `ParticleSystem`.

// ... existing code ...

- Refactor `CollisionSystem` to source these parameters from `gridParams` passed via `ParticleSystem`.

## Analysis: TurbulenceField Parameters (2024-08-01)

**Context:** Examining `Sim/src/simulation/forces/turbulenceField.js` for parameter consolidation as part of Phase B.

**Findings:**

- The constructor accepts a very large number of configuration parameters (>30) controlling strength, scale, speed, rotation, patterns, contrast, bias physics, etc.
- Centralizing _all_ these parameters into `gridParams.turbulence` would significantly bloat the main `gridParams` object.

**Options Considered:**

1.  **Full Consolidation:** Add all ~30+ params to `gridParams.turbulence`. (Likely too complex).
2.  **Partial Consolidation:** Add only key params (e.g., strength, scale, speed) to `gridParams.turbulence`. (Better, but still adds specific component config to global params).
3.  **Dedicated Config Object:** Refactor constructor to accept a specific `config` object within the main `params` (e.g., `params.config`), keeping `gridParams` clean. Configuration would be passed during instantiation, not sourced from global `gridParams`.

**Recommendation:**

- Opt for **Option 3 (Dedicated Config Object)** to avoid polluting the global `gridParams` with component-specific details.
- Plan: Refactor `TurbulenceField` constructor to expect parameters within `params.config` instead of directly in `params`. Update the instantiation call in `main.js` accordingly (passing an empty config `{}` initially, as UI will manage the actual values).

## Phase C Analysis: `GridGeometry` (Sim vs. Grid)

**1. Constructor:**

- `Sim`: Takes `dimensionValues` object directly.
- `Grid`: Takes no arguments. Assumes `dimensions` will be passed to `generate`.

**2. `generate` Method Signature:**

- `Sim`: `generate(params, boundary)` - Requires caller to merge `gridParams` and other params. Relies on `this.dimensionValues` stored in constructor.
- `Grid`: `generate(gridParams, boundary, dimensions)` - Explicitly takes `gridParams`, `boundary`, and `dimensions` objects separately.

**3. Parameter Source:**

- `Sim`: Reads configuration from a combined `params` object (`params.grid.allowCut`, `params.gap`, `params.centerOffsetX`, etc.) and uses `this.dimensionValues` for scaling/sizes.
- `Grid`: Reads configuration explicitly from `gridParams.gridSpecs` (`allowCut`, `scale`, `aspectRatio`, `gap`, `centerOffsetX`, `centerOffsetY`) and uses the passed-in `dimensions` object for scaling/sizes.

**4. Internal State:**

- `Sim`: Stores results in `this.rectangles` and `this.gridParams`.
- `Grid`: Stores results in `this.rectangles` and `this.geomParams`.

**5. Calculation Logic:**

- Both use a similar iterative approach starting from `maxVisualCellHeight`.
- `Grid` includes more detailed debugging logs.
- `Grid` applies `gridParams.gridSpecs.scale` directly when calculating `maxCols`/`maxRows` based on boundary size, which seems more correct than `Sim`'s approach.
- `Grid` appears to have slightly different logic for calculating `physicalCellH_` and `scaledW_`, `scaledH_` vs `visualScaledW_`, `visualScaledH_` (requires closer look, potentially related to `Grid`'s refactoring for better parameter search).
- `Grid` has logic (commented as Plan Steps) related to finding a target count and optimizing the parameter search, which `Sim` lacks.

**6. Dependencies:**

- `Sim`: Imports `gl-matrix/mat4.js`, which is not used in the provided snippet. Imports boundary shapes.
- `Grid`: Only imports boundary shapes.

**Conclusion:** `Grid`'s version is more aligned with the project's goal of centralized parameters (`gridParams`), explicitly requires necessary data (`dimensions`) in `generate`, and seems to have more refined calculation logic, especially regarding scaling and parameter searching. `Sim`'s version relies on potentially outdated `dimensionValues` stored at construction and less clear parameter structure in `generate`.

## Phase C Analysis: `OverlayManager` (Sim vs. Grid)

**1. Constructor Dependencies:**

- `Sim`: Requires `canvasElement` and `dimensionManager`.
- `Grid`: Requires only `canvasElement`. Explicitly commented out `dimensionManager`. Gets dimension info passed into `updateDimensions`, `updateCellIndices`, `updateCellCenters` methods.

**2. Initialization (`#initOverlays`):**

- `Sim`: Uses `this.dimensionManager` to get initial overlay size.
- `Grid`: Takes `initialWidth`, `initialHeight` as arguments (uses placeholders in constructor call). Relies on `updateDimensions` to set correct size later.
- `Grid`: Uses CSS classes (`overlay-container`, `canvas-relative-container`) for some styling instead of only inline styles.

**3. `updateDimensions` Method:**

- `Sim`: Reads dimensions directly from `this.dimensionManager`. Positions overlay using `canvas.offsetTop/offsetLeft`.
- `Grid`: Takes `dimensions` object as an argument. Positions overlay using `canvas.getBoundingClientRect()` plus `window.scrollY/scrollX` for accurate positioning relative to the viewport, accounting for scroll. Sizes overlay based on `getBoundingClientRect()` width/height.

**4. `updateCellIndices` / `updateCellCenters` Methods:**

- `Sim`: Takes only `rectangles`. Reads dimensions from `this.dimensionManager`. Scales elements based on `canvas.width/height` vs `renderWidth/Height`.
- `Grid`: Takes `rectangles`, `gridParams`, and `dimensions`. Uses passed `dimensions`. Scales elements based on `canvas.getBoundingClientRect().width/height` vs `renderWidth/Height` (using actual rendered size).
- `Grid` `updateCellIndices`: Gets `originalIndex` using `indexOf`.
- `Grid`: Adds `clearCellIndices` and `clearCellCenters` methods.
- `Sim` `updateCellIndices`: Has a duplicate `label.textContent = ...` line.

**5. Styling & DOM:**

- `Sim`: Primarily uses inline styles.
- `Grid`: Uses some CSS classes (e.g., `.overlay-container`, `.canvas-relative-container`, `.cell-index-text`) and fewer inline styles, suggesting a move towards CSS-based styling.

**Conclusion:** `Grid`'s version is less coupled, removing the direct dependency on `DimensionManager` in the constructor. It uses more robust positioning (`getBoundingClientRect`) and separates concerns better by requiring necessary data (`dimensions`) to be passed into methods. It also leans more towards CSS classes for styling. `Sim`'s version is tightly coupled to `DimensionManager` and uses less accurate positioning logic.

## Phase C: Renderer Alignment Analysis (Sim vs. Grid) - 2024-07-27

**Objective:** Compare `Sim/src/renderer/simGridRendererInstanced.js` and `Grid/src/renderer/gridGenRenderer.js` to identify differences before potential merging or refactoring.

**Files Analyzed:**

- `Sim/src/renderer/simGridRendererInstanced.js`
- `Grid/src/renderer/gridGenRenderer.js`

**Key Differences Found:**

1.  **Class Name & Dependencies:**

    - Sim: `SimGridRendererInstanced`, injects `DimensionManager`, `GridGeometry`, `OverlayManager`, `Gradient`, boundaries.
    - Grid: `GridGenRenderer`, injects boundaries, instantiates `GridGeometry`, `OverlayManager` internally. Lacks `DimensionManager`, `Gradient`.

2.  **Configuration & Dimensions:**

    - Sim: Uses `params` object, receives `dimensionValues` separately. `setGrid` takes `newParams`, `newDimensions`, boundaries. Updates viewport/canvas/overlays based on `newDimensions`. Updates `params.grid.grid` with calculated geometry.
    - Grid: Uses `gridConfig`, receives `dimensions` directly. `setGrid` takes `newGridConfig`, boundaries, `dimensions`. Updates viewport/overlays based on `dimensions`. Updates `gridConfig` directly with calculated geometry. Parameter paths differ (e.g., `grid.grid.shadow...` vs `grid.shadow...`).

3.  **Color Handling (Major Difference):**

    - Sim: **Data-driven color.** Has `updateInstanceColors(dataArray)` using a `Gradient` instance to map normalized data (0-1) to individual cell colors via a lookup table. Uploads color buffer separately.
    - Grid: **Uniform color.** `prepareInstanceData` takes a single `finalCellColor` and applies it to all instances in the color buffer. No data mapping or `Gradient`.

4.  **Instancing (`prepareInstanceData`):**

    - Sim: Calculates matrices in render coordinates. Handles shadow params (vec4 from `grid.grid`). _Does not_ handle color here.
    - Grid: Calculates matrices converting to clip space coordinates. Handles shadow params (vec3 from `grid.shadow`). _Does_ handle uniform color here.

5.  **Instancing (`setupInstancedDrawing`):**

    - Sim: Sets up attributes for position, matrix (mat4), shadow (vec4). Does _not_ explicitly set up color attribute binding here.
    - Grid: Sets up attributes for position, matrix (mat4), color (vec4), shadow (vec3). Includes more attribute location checks.

6.  **Physics Boundary Rendering:**

    - Sim: Actively renders the physics boundary if enabled.
    - Grid: Code for rendering physics boundary is present but commented out.

7.  **Overlays:**

    - Sim: `overlayManager` injected. Updates indices, centers, and count display. `updateDimensions()` takes no args.
    - Grid: `overlayManager` internal. Updates indices, centers. `updateDimensions()` takes `dimensions`. No count display update.

8.  **Removed Functionality (Grid):**
    - Particle rendering code (`_updateParticleData`, buffers, shader logic) explicitly removed.

**Conclusion:** Significant differences exist, primarily in dependency management, configuration handling, and fundamentally different approaches to cell coloring (data-driven vs. uniform). Alignment would require addressing these core architectural divergences.

## Phase C Analysis Synthesis: GridGeometry (Sim vs. Grid) - 2024-07-27

**Objective:** Document definitive differences and alignment needs based on comparative analysis.

**Differences & Alignment Needs:**

1.  **Constructor & `generate` Signature:**

    - `Sim`: Takes `dimensionValues` in constructor, `generate(params, boundary)` relies on stored dimensions.
    - `Grid`: No constructor args, `generate(gridParams, boundary, dimensions)` explicitly takes needed data.
    - **Alignment:** Refactor `Sim`'s `generate` to match `Grid`'s signature (`generate(gridParams, boundary, dimensions)`), removing constructor dependency on `dimensionValues`. Pass required data explicitly during the call in `main.js`.

2.  **Parameter Source & Structure:**

    - `Sim`: Reads from combined `params` (`params.grid.allowCut`), uses `this.dimensionValues`.
    - `Grid`: Reads from `gridParams.gridSpecs` (`allowCut`, `scale`) and passed `dimensions`.
    - **Alignment:** Update `Sim`'s `generate` to read parameters from the passed `gridParams` object using the structure established in `Grid` (e.g., `gridParams.gridSpecs.scale`) and use the passed `dimensions` object.

3.  **Internal State:**

    - `Sim`: Stores results in `this.rectangles`, `this.gridParams`.
    - `Grid`: Stores results in `this.rectangles`, `this.geomParams`.
    - **Alignment:** Standardize on `this.geomParams` in `Sim` for storing calculated geometric parameters.

4.  **Calculation Logic:**

    - `Grid` applies `gridParams.gridSpecs.scale` more directly in extent calculations.
    - `Grid` has a more refined parameter search logic (two-phase generation in latest version).
    - **Alignment:** Adapt `Sim`'s calculation logic to incorporate the refined two-phase approach from `Grid`'s version. Ensure scale is applied correctly during extent calculation.

5.  **Dependencies:**
    - `Sim`: Unused `gl-matrix/mat4.js` import.
    - `Grid`: No unused imports noted.
    - **Alignment:** Remove unused `gl-matrix` import from `Sim's `GridGeometry`.

## Phase C Analysis: OverlayManager (Sim vs. Grid) - 2024-07-27

**Objective:** Document definitive differences and alignment needs based on comparative analysis.

**Differences & Alignment Needs:**

1.  **Constructor Dependencies:**

    - `Sim`: Requires `canvasElement` and `dimensionManager`. Tightly coupled.
    - `Grid`: Requires only `canvasElement`. Decoupled from `DimensionManager`.
    - **Alignment:** Refactor `Sim`'s `OverlayManager` constructor to remove the `dimensionManager` dependency. Modify methods (`updateDimensions`, `updateCellIndices`, `updateCellCenters`) to accept the required `dimensions` object as an argument. Update instantiation and method calls in `Sim's `SimGridRendererInstanced`.

2.  **Initialization (`#initOverlays`):**

    - `Sim`: Uses `this.dimensionManager` for initial size.
    - `Grid`: Takes `initialWidth/Height` args (placeholders used), relies on `updateDimensions`. Uses CSS classes.
    - **Alignment:** Remove reliance on `dimensionManager` in `Sim's `#initOverlays`. Use placeholders or default values, ensuring `updateDimensions` is called correctly after instantiation with actual dimensions. Adopt CSS classes (`overlay-container`, etc.) from `Grid's CSS files (`canvas-overlays.css`) for base styling.

3.  **`updateDimensions` Method:**

    - `Sim`: Reads from `this.dimensionManager`. Uses `canvas.offsetTop/Left` for positioning (less accurate).
    - `Grid`: Takes `dimensions` argument. Uses `canvas.getBoundingClientRect()` + `window.scrollX/Y` (more accurate positioning). Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` for sizing.
    - **Alignment:** Refactor `Sim`'s `updateDimensions` to accept the `dimensions` argument. Implement the more accurate positioning and sizing logic using `getBoundingClientRect()` as seen in `Grid`.

4.  **`updateCellIndices` / `updateCellCenters` Methods:**

    - `Sim`: Takes only `rectangles`. Reads dimensions from `this.dimensionManager`. Scales based on `canvas.width/height` vs `renderWidth/Height`.
    - `Grid`: Takes `rectangles`, `gridParams`, `dimensions`. Uses passed `dimensions`. Scales based on `getBoundingClientRect().width/height` vs `renderWidth/Height` (more accurate). Uses `indexOf` for `originalIndex`. Adds `clearCellIndices` and `clearCellCenters` methods.
    - **Alignment:** Refactor `Sim` methods to accept `gridParams` and `dimensions`. Implement scaling based on `getBoundingClientRect()`. Fix duplicate line. Add `clear...` methods for better state management. Implement `originalIndex` retrieval using `indexOf`.

5.  **Styling & DOM:**
    - `Sim`: Primarily uses inline styles.
    - `Grid`: Uses CSS classes + fewer inline styles.
    - **Alignment:** Refactor `Sim` to use CSS classes defined in `Grid's CSS files (`canvas-overlays.css`) for base styling, reducing reliance on inline styles.

**Deprecation Decision:**

- **`debugRenderer.js`:** Should be **kept** as a separate optional rendering layer for debugging purposes.
- **`gridRenderer.js`:** To be **eventually deprecated**, but **kept active for now**. It will be fully removed only after `SimGridRendererInstanced` is refactored, verified, and fully integrated with the `ParticleSystem` for data visualization.

---

## Phase C Analysis Synthesis: Decision Point (2024-07-27)

**Objective:** Define the refactoring strategy based on completed analysis (Steps 1-4) and determine deprecation needs.

**Findings:**

- `Sim/src/rendering/gridRenderer.js` and `Sim/src/rendering/debugRenderer.js` **DO exist**. Previous analysis was incorrect.
- `gridRenderer.js`: Original, inefficient, per-cell drawing renderer using stencil masking.
- `debugRenderer.js`: Provides distinct debug overlays (velocity field, noise fields, basic grid, partial boundary viz). Its functionality is _not_ covered by `SimGridRendererInstanced`.

**Refactoring Strategy:**

1.  **`GridGeometry` (`Sim/src/coreGrid/gridGeometry.js`):**

    - Refactor `generate` signature to `generate(gridParams, boundary, dimensions)`.
    - Update internal logic to read parameters from passed `gridParams` (nested structure, e.g., `gridParams.gridSpecs.scale`).
    - Use passed `dimensions` object for scaling/size calculations.
    - Implement the two-phase generation logic from `Grid`'s version.
    - Store calculated geometry parameters in `this.geomParams`.
    - Remove unused `gl-matrix` import.

2.  **`OverlayManager` (`Sim/src/managers/overlayManager.js`):**

    - Remove `dimensionManager` dependency from constructor.
    - Modify `updateDimensions`, `updateCellIndices`, `updateCellCenters` to accept `dimensions` (and `gridParams` where needed).
    - Implement positioning/scaling using `getBoundingClientRect()`.
    - Add `clearCellIndices`/`clearCellCenters` methods.
    - Adopt CSS classes (`overlay-container`, etc.) for base styling.

3.  **`SimGridRendererInstanced` (`Sim/src/rendering/SimGridRendererInstanced.js`):**
    - Remove `DimensionManager` dependency.
    - Refactor `setGrid` to accept `gridConfig` (nested structure) and `dimensions`.
    - Instantiate `GridGeometry` and `OverlayManager` internally.
    - Keep `Gradient` injected.
    - Retain data-driven color approach (`updateInstanceColors`).
    - Refactor `prepareInstanceData` for clip-space matrices and standardized shadow parameters.
    - Ensure `setupInstancedDrawing` correctly binds the per-instance color attribute.
    - Update internal calls to `GridGeometry` and `OverlayManager` methods with required arguments (`gridConfig`, `dimensions`).
    - Retain active physics boundary rendering logic.

**Deprecation Decision:**

- **`debugRenderer.js`:** Should be **kept** as a separate optional rendering layer for debugging purposes.
- **`gridRenderer.js`:** To be **eventually deprecated**, but **kept active for now**. It will be fully removed only after `SimGridRendererInstanced` is refactored, verified, and fully integrated with the `ParticleSystem` for data visualization.

_(Proceeding to Phase 2...)_

**Phase 2: Core Grid Component Comparison (`coreGrid`)**

- **Step 4: Boundary Files (`coreGrid/boundary/`)**
  - `Grid`: Contains `baseBoundaryShape.js`, `circularBoundaryShape.js`, `rectangularBoundaryShape.js`.
  - `Sim`: Directory `Sim/src/coreGrid/boundary` is empty. Previous analysis (pre-revert) indicated identical files existed. Files likely missing in reverted state or located elsewhere.

**Step 6: DimensionManager (`dimensionManager.js`)**

- `Grid`: File `Grid/src/coreGrid/dimensionManager.js` exists and was read.
- `Sim`: File `Sim/src/coreGrid/dimensionManager.js` not found at expected location. File likely missing in reverted state.

- `Grid` has the aligned instanced `gridGenRenderer`, a very minimal `baseRenderer`, and a `boundaryRenderer`.
- The `baseRenderer.js` files differ significantly in size and likely content.

- **`Sim/gridRenderer.js` (Legacy):**
  - Dependencies: `BaseRenderer`, `GridRenderModes`, `Gradient`, `socketManager`.
  - Structure: Manages its own `gridParams`, `gridGeometry` generation (complex `generateRectangles`), `gridMap`, overlays (manual DOM manipulation), `Gradient`, `socketManager`, `renderModes`.
  - Rendering: Iterative `drawRectangle` calls per cell. Uses stencil buffering for masking. Data-driven color via `GridRenderModes` and `Gradient`.
  - Configuration: Takes only `gl` and `shaderManager` in constructor. Configuration mostly hardcoded or internal.
  - Overlays: Manages `centerOverlay` and `textOverlay` directly using DOM.
  - Instancing: None.
- **`Grid/gridGenRenderer.js` (Aligned):**
  - Dependencies: `BaseRenderer`, `gl-matrix/mat4`, `GridGeometry`, `OverlayManager`.
  - Structure: Instantiates `GridGeometry`, `OverlayManager`. Receives `gridConfig`, `shapeBoundary`, `physicsBoundary`, `dimensions` externally (via `setGrid`).
  - Rendering: Instanced drawing (`drawArraysInstanced`) based on a base quad. Prepares instance data (matrices, colors, shadow params). Color is currently uniform (passed to `prepareInstanceData`). Physics boundary drawing code exists but is commented out.
  - Configuration: Takes `gl`, `shaderManager`, initial `gridConfig`, boundaries in constructor. Updated via `setGrid` method.
  - Overlays: Delegates overlay management to injected `OverlayManager`.
  - Instancing: Yes, uses `gl.drawArraysInstanced`.

**Key Differences:**

- **Rendering Method:** Legacy draws each cell individually; Aligned uses instancing for efficiency.
- **Dependency Management:** Legacy manages many components internally; Aligned relies more on external injection and composition (boundaries, `OverlayManager`, `GridGeometry`).
- **Configuration:** Legacy has much internal state; Aligned receives configuration externally via `gridConfig` and `dimensions` objects.
- **Color:** Legacy uses complex data-driven color (via `GridRenderModes`/`Gradient`); Aligned currently uses simple uniform color (needs adaptation for Sim data).
- **Overlays:** Legacy manages DOM directly; Aligned uses `OverlayManager` class.
- **Components:** Legacy bundles geometry generation; Aligned uses separate `GridGeometry` class.

_(Proceeding to Step 11...)_

**Step 11: Base Renderer Comparison (`baseRenderer.js`)**

- **`Sim/baseRenderer.js` (Legacy):**
  - Exports `class BaseRenderer { ... }` using `export { BaseRenderer };` at the end.
  - Constructor: Takes `gl`, `shaderManager`. Creates `this.vertexBuffer`.
  - Methods: Includes `drawCircle` method with logic for drawing circles using `TRIANGLE_FAN`.
  - Size: ~1.3KB.
- **`Grid/baseRenderer.js` (Aligned):**
  - Exports `export class BaseRenderer { ... }` directly.
  - Constructor: Takes `gl`, `shaderManager`. Performs basic validation. No buffer creation.
  - Methods: No additional methods (like `drawCircle`).
  - Size: ~0.3KB.

**Key Differences:**

- **Functionality:** Sim's version includes basic drawing utilities (`drawCircle`) and buffer management; Grid's is purely a minimal base class holding `gl` and `shaderManager` references.
- **Export Syntax:** Sim uses named export at the end; Grid uses direct class export.
- **Inheritance Goal:** Grid's seems designed simply to enforce dependency injection for renderers; Sim's provided some shared (but potentially misplaced) utility.

\_(Proceeding to Step 12...)\*

**Step 12: Other Rendering Support Files**

- **Shader Management:**
  - `Sim`: `Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js` (12KB), `Sim/src/shaders/rectangle.glsl`, `Sim/src/shaders/gradients.js`.
  - `Grid`: `Grid/src/shader/shaderManager.js` (4KB), shader definitions in `Grid/src/shader/shaders/*.js` (`gridCell.js`, `particles.js`).
  - _Difference:_ Grid uses a refactored/simpler `ShaderManager` and embeds shader source in JS modules. Sim uses separate `.glsl` files and has explicit gradient management.
- **Grid Data Visualization:**
  - `Sim`: `Sim/src/renderer/gridRenderModes.js` (31KB). Handles calculating and smoothing various data fields (Density, Velocity, Pressure, etc.) from the `particleSystem` for display on the grid, tightly coupled with the legacy `gridRenderer`.
  - `Grid`: No direct equivalent. `gridGenRenderer` currently supports only uniform color.
- **Boundary Rendering:**
  - `Sim`: Handled within legacy `gridRenderer.js` (drawing logic) or potentially `debugRenderer.js`.
  - `Grid`: Dedicated `Grid/src/renderer/boundaryRenderer.js` (6KB) using DOM elements for physics boundary visualization, decoupled from the main grid renderer.
- **Other Sim Renderers:** `Sim` also has `particleRenderer.js`, `debugRenderer.js`, `emuRenderer.js`, which have no direct counterparts in the `Grid` template structure.

_(End of Phase 3. Proceeding to Phase 4...)_

**Phase 4: Overlay Component Comparison (`overlays`)**

- **Step 13: OverlayManager (`overlayManager.js`)**
  - `Grid`: File `Grid/src/renderer/overlayRenderer.js` exists and was read.
  - `Sim`: File `Sim/src/overlays/overlayManager.js` not found at expected location or via search. File likely missing in reverted state. (Note: `Sim/src/overlays/` directory exists).
  - **Decision:** Use `Grid` `overlayRenderer.js` as the definitive source.

**File Refactoring:** Renamed `Grid/src/overlays/overlayManager.js` to `Grid/src/renderer/overlayRenderer.js` and moved it to the `renderer` directory. Updated import paths in `Grid/src/renderer/gridGenRenderer.js`.

_(End of Phase 4. Proceeding to Phase 5...)_

**Phase 5: Simulation Core Component Comparison (`simulation/core`)**

- **Step 14: ParticleSystem (`particleSystem.js`)**
  - `Grid`: File `Grid/src/simulation/core/particleSystem.js` does not exist (or search interrupted). Unlikely to exist in grid-focused template.
  - `Sim`: File `Sim/src/simulation/core/particleSystem.js` exists and was read. This is the core of the Sim functionality.
  - **Conclusion:** `particleSystem.js` is unique to `Sim` and represents the main component to integrate with the aligned `Grid` components.

_(End of Phase 5. Proceeding to Phase 6...)_

**Step 15: FluidFLIP (`fluidFLIP.js`)**

- `Grid`: File `Grid/src/simulation/core/fluidFLIP.js` does not exist (or search interrupted). Unlikely to exist in grid-focused template.
- `Sim`: File `Sim/src/simulation/core/fluidFLIP.js` exists and was read.
- **Conclusion:** `fluidFLIP.js` is unique to `Sim`.

\_(End of Phase 5. Proceeding to Phase 6...)\*

**Phase 6: Physics Boundary Comparison (`simulation/boundary`)**

- **Step 16: File Comparison**
  - **Directory Contents:** Similar, but `Grid` uses `Ps` suffix (e.g., `circularBoundaryPs.js`, `baseBoundaryPs.js`, `boundaryPsUtils.js`) while `Sim` does not.
  - **`baseBoundary.js` vs `baseBoundaryPs.js`:** Almost identical. Grid version has comments noting callback logic needs rework and is commented out.
  - **`circularBoundary.js` vs `circularBoundaryPs.js`:** Very similar logic. Sim version includes a WebGL `drawBoundary` method, absent in Grid. Grid version has slightly different collision detection logic and an explicit `setRadius` method.
  - **`rectangularBoundary.js` vs `rectangularBoundaryPs.js`:** Very similar logic. Sim version includes a WebGL `drawBoundary` method, absent in Grid. Sim version includes a `getRadius()` method.
  - **`boundaryUtils.js` vs `boundaryPsUtils.js`:** Identical core logic. Differ only in class names used internally and export syntax.
  - **Conclusion:** The `Grid` versions (`*Ps.js`) represent a minor refactoring, primarily removing direct drawing responsibility and potentially tweaking collision logic. Sim versions contain legacy WebGL drawing code.

_(End of Phase 6. Proceeding to Phase 7...)_

**Phase 7: Manager Component Comparison (`managers`)**

- **Step 17 & 18: Directory Contents:**
  - Neither `Sim/src/managers/` nor `Grid/src/managers/` directory found.
  - Conclusion: Manager components are likely located elsewhere (e.g., `shaderManager` is in `shaders/` and `shader/`).
- **Step 19: ShaderManager Comparison (`Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js` vs `Grid/src/shader/shaderManager.js`)**
  - **Structure:** Sim embeds GLSL strings; Grid imports JS modules containing GLSL strings.
  - **Complexity:** Sim's is larger (12KB vs 4KB) and defines more shaders internally. Grid's is simpler, imports `gridCell` and `particles` externally.
  - **Other:** Sim has a `cleanup` method, Grid does not. Sim `init` was async, Grid `init` is sync.
  - **Conclusion:** Grid uses a refactored approach with external JS modules for shader source and a streamlined manager.

\_(End of Phase 7. Proceeding to Phase 8...)\*

**Phase 8: Documentation and Synthesis**

- **Step 20:** Comparison notes reviewed.
- **Step 21:** `memoryBank/architecture_grid.md` updated with verified Grid state.
- **Step 22:** `memoryBank/architecture_sim.md` updated with target Sim state post-migration.
- **Step 23: High-Level Migration Strategy:**
  1.  **Direct Replacement:** Copy `Grid`'s `coreGrid`, `overlays`, `simulation/boundary`, and `shader` components/structure into `Sim`, replacing missing or legacy versions.
  2.  **Core Integration:** Modify `Sim/src/main.js` to instantiate and use the new components (e.g., `BoundaryManager`, `gridGenRenderer`, `OverlayManager`, `ShaderManager`).
  3.  **Particle System Adaptation:** Update `Sim/src/simulation/core/particleSystem.js` to interact with the new `BoundaryManager` (get physics boundary) and potentially other migrated components as needed.
  4.  **Data Visualization Hookup:** Refactor `Sim`'s data processing logic (from legacy `gridRenderModes.js`) into a new module/class. Adapt `gridGenRenderer.js` to call this module and use its output (e.g., per-cell color data) instead of uniform color.
  5.  **Renderer Harmonization:** Ensure existing `Sim` renderers (`particleRenderer`, `debugRenderer`, `emuRenderer`) correctly use the migrated `ShaderManager` and function alongside the new `gridGenRenderer` and `boundaryRenderer`.
  6.  **Cleanup (Deferred):** Plan for eventual removal of unused legacy Sim components after migration is stable.

_(Analysis Phase Complete. Ready for Refined Plan)_

## Renderer & ShaderManager Refinement (2024-08-02)

**Objective:** Refactor Sim renderers for clarity and align ShaderManagers between Sim and Grid projects.

**Execution Log:**

1.  **Velocity Field Refactoring:**
    - Moved velocity field rendering logic from `Sim/src/renderer/debugRenderer.js` into `Sim/src/renderer/particleRenderer.js`.
    - Added `showVelocityField` toggle property and `velocityLineBuffer` to `ParticleRenderer`.
    - Removed corresponding logic and UI controls from `DebugRenderer` and `DebugUi`.
    - Noted (and kept for now) a change in `y2` calculation (`+ p.vy` vs `- p.vy`).
2.  **Sim Shader Cleanup:**
    - Attempted phased removal of unused shaders (`basic`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `grid`, `boundary`) from `Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js`.
    - Initially kept `basic` due to usage in `gridRenderer.js` and `debugRenderer.js`.
    - Successfully removed `rectangle`.
    - Failed to automatically remove `circle`.
3.  **Stencil Logic Removal (`gridRenderer.js`):**
    - Analyzed stencil buffer usage in `Sim/src/renderer/gridRenderer.js`.
    - Experimentally commented out stencil logic; confirmed visual output was unchanged.
    - Permanently removed stencil logic and the associated `drawCircle` method (which used the `basic` shader).
4.  **Revisit Basic Shader Removal:**
    - With stencil logic gone, `gridRenderer.js` no longer used the `basic` shader.
    - Successfully removed the `basic` shader definition from `Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js`. (Remaining usage in `debugRenderer.js` did not immediately block removal).
5.  **ShaderManager Alignment:**
    - Standardized on `vert`/`frag` keys for shader definitions.
    - Updated `Grid/src/shader/shaderManager.js`: Changed `particles` keys to `vert`/`frag`; added `await` to `createProgram` call in `init`.
    - Updated `Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js`: Renamed original `gridCell` to `gridCell_LEGACY`; added instanced `gridCell` from Grid; confirmed `particles` and `lines` keys were correct.
    - Updated `Sim/src/renderer/gridRenderer.js`: Changed `drawRectangle` to use `gridCell_LEGACY` shader.

**Current Shader Protocol:**

- Shaders are defined inline within a `static SHADERS = { ... };` object inside the `ShaderManager` class.
- Each shader entry uses `vert` and `frag` keys for the vertex and fragment source code (provided as template literals).
- The `ShaderManager.init()` method asynchronously compiles shaders using `await this.createProgram(...)`.
- The `init()` method logic in both `Sim` and `Grid` supports either `vert`/`vertex` or `frag`/`fragment` keys, but the standard convention is now `vert`/`frag`.

**Status:** Renderers (`ParticleRenderer`, `GridRenderer`) have been cleaned up. ShaderManagers (`Sim`, `Grid`) are aligned in terms of key naming conventions and initialization logic. `Sim` now contains both legacy and instanced versions of the `gridCell` shader.

**CSS in JS Analysis (Sim/):**

- **Inline Styles (`.style.`) Found:**
  - `Sim/src/util/statsModule.js`
  - `Sim/src/util/noisePreviewManager.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/turbulenceUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/randomizerUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/pulseModulationUi.js`
- **`classList.add(` Usage Found:**
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/turbulenceUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/randomizerUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/pulseModulationUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/paramUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/organicUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/inputModulationUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/ui/panels/gravityUi.js`
  - `Sim/src/renderer/gridRenderer.js`
  - `Sim/src/presets/presetManager.js`

**CSS Refactoring & Protocol Update:**

- Refactored `Sim/src/util/noisePreviewManager.js` (`updateSelectedUI` method) to use CSS classes (`noise-preview-element`, `selected`, `disabled`) instead of inline styles for border management. Corresponding CSS rules added to `Sim/src/ui/css/noise.css`. Added `noise-preview-element` base class during element creation in `Sim/src/ui/panels/turbulenceUi.js`.
- Proposed adding a "STATE-BASED STYLING PRINCIPLE" to `riper-5.mdc` to promote using classes over inline styles for state-driven UI changes.

**CSS Refactoring (`randomizerUi.js`):**

- **Re-Scan Results:** Inline styles (`.style.`) remain in `statsModule.js`, `noisePreviewManager.js`, `turbulenceUi.js`, `randomizerUi.js`, `pulseModulationUi.js`, `presetUi.js` (and potentially others due to truncation).
- **Refactoring:**
  - Added CSS rules to `Sim/src/ui/css/randomizer.css` for `.randomizer-title`, `.randomizer-button-container`, `.target-selection-button-container`, `.randomizer-button` (base, :hover, .disabled), `.target-selection-button` (base, :hover, .active).
  - Modified `Sim/src/ui/panels/randomizerUi.js`:
    - Removed inline styles for title, containers, and buttons.
    - Applied CSS classes (`randomizer-title`, `randomizer-button-container`, `target-selection-button-container`, `randomizer-button`, `target-selection-button`).
    - Replaced button `backgroundColor` updates with `classList.toggle` (`disabled` for randomize, `active` for target selection).
    - Removed JavaScript hover event listeners for buttons.

## Verification and Planning Reset (2024-08-02)

**Objective:** Verify codebase state against `memoryBank/plan.md` ("LEGACY Component Isolation...") and recent notebook entries (CSS/Shader refactoring).

**Verification Results:**

- **CSS Refactoring:** Verified as complete for `randomizerUi.js` and `noisePreviewManager.js`.
- **Shader Alignment:** Verified as complete in `Sim/src/shaders/shaderManager.js`.
- **Plan Phase A (Renames):** Verification **Inconclusive** due to repeated file search tool interruptions. Cannot confirm existence of `LEGACY_` prefixed files.
- **Plan Phase B (Imports):** **INCOMPLETE.** Grep search confirmed that imports for `gridRenderModes.js` (in `paramUi.js`, `gridRenderer.js`) and `gridRenderer.js` (in `main.js`) were **not** updated to use the `LEGACY_` prefix as required by the plan.
- **Plan Phase C (Copies):** Verification **Inconclusive** due to repeated file search tool interruptions. Cannot confirm existence of newly copied aligned components (`overlayManager.js`, `circularBoundaryPs.js`, `gridGenRenderer.js`).

**Conclusion:**

Significant discrepancies exist between the documented plan steps and the verifiable state of the codebase (specifically, the incomplete import updates). Combined with the inability to confirm file renames and copies, there appears to be a disconnect between the intended plan execution and the actual result.

**Decision:**

- **Discard Current Plan:** The plan titled "LEGACY Component Isolation and Aligned Grid Integration (Corrected)" in `memoryBank/plan.md` is now considered obsolete due to the identified inconsistencies and verification failures.
- **Initiate New Planning Cycle:** A new plan will be created based on a fresh analysis of the _current_ state of the `Sim` project codebase. This requires re-entering the THINK phase to gather accurate information.

**Next Step:** Perform a new THINK phase analysis to establish a reliable baseline of the current `Sim` codebase structure and component status before formulating a new plan.

## Project State Correction & New Direction (2024-08-02)

**Correction:** Previous assumptions about plan execution (renaming legacy files, copying aligned Grid files) were incorrect. The current state of the `Sim` project is:

1.  **Reverted Base:** The codebase reflects the `Sim` project state _before_ the migration attempts detailed in the now-discarded plan.
2.  **Applied Refactors:** CSS (class-based styling) and ShaderManager (structure/key alignment) refactoring has been successfully applied _to this reverted base_.
3.  **No Grid Files Copied:** No files from the `Grid` project template have been introduced into `Sim` yet.

**New Priority: Statelessness**

The primary goal is now to refactor `Sim` components towards statelessness, aligning with principles potentially derived from a related C# refactor. The immediate focus is on ensuring components rely on data passed into methods rather than maintaining internal state across operations.

**Next Step:** Discuss the statelessness philosophy and identify candidate components in `Sim` for refactoring analysis.

## Renderer Directory State Verification (2024-08-02)

**Objective:** Verify the actual contents of `Sim/src/renderer/` to establish an accurate baseline, correcting previous assumptions based on outdated notebook entries.

**Findings:**
Direct listing of `Sim/src/renderer/` revealed the following files:

- `gridRenderer.js` (27KB)
- `particleRenderer.js` (5.7KB)
- `baseRenderer.js` (1.3KB)
- `gridRenderModes.js` (31KB)
- `emuRenderer.js` (20KB)

**Correction:** The files `gridRenderer.js` and `gridRenderModes.js` have **not** been renamed to `LEGACY_` as previously assumed based on the discarded plan. The `debugRenderer.js` file, mentioned in prior analysis, is not present in this listing.

**Conclusion:** The renderer directory state confirms that the migration plan involving renaming/copying was not executed. Analysis must proceed based on these actual files.

## Renderer Statelessness Analysis Synthesis (2024-08-02)

Based on the analysis of files in `Sim/src/renderer/`:

- **`baseRenderer.js`:**

  - **Finding:** Stateless.
  - **Reasoning:** Minimal base class holding injected dependencies (`gl`, `shaderManager`) only.

- **`particleRenderer.js`:**

  - **Finding:** Largely stateless for its core `draw` operation.
  - **Reasoning:** `draw` method primarily relies on input `particles` and internal configuration/WebGL resource properties, without accumulating application state across calls.

- **`gridRenderer.js`:**

  - **Finding:** Highly stateful.
  - **Reasoning:** Manages persistent internal state for `gridParams`, `gridGeometry`, `gridMap`, `renderModes`, `gradient`, `maxDensity`, DOM overlays, and socket connection. `draw` method depends heavily on this internal state.

- **`gridRenderModes.js`:**

  - **Finding:** Highly stateful.
  - **Reasoning:** Manages internal data arrays (`values`, `targetValues`, `currentValues`), `currentMode`, and applies smoothing introducing temporal dependency. Relies on external state (`gridGeometry`/`gridMap`) and calculation methods modify internal state arrays.

- **`emuRenderer.js`:**
  - **Finding:** Extremely stateful and tightly coupled (Controller/View pattern).
  - **Reasoning:** Manages internal UI interaction state, joystick physics, animation loop. Directly reads _and modifies_ state in external components (`emuForces`, `Gravity`, `TurbulenceField`) and manipulates DOM elements. Rendering is entangled with input handling and external updates.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The `Sim` renderers vary significantly. `baseRenderer` and `particleRenderer` align reasonably well with stateless principles for their core operations. However, `gridRenderer`, `gridRenderModes`, and especially `emuRenderer` exhibit substantial statefulness and coupling. Refactoring these towards statelessness (passing necessary data/state into methods) would require significant architectural changes to separate concerns (state management, calculation, input handling, rendering).

## Decoupling via Event Bus (Grid Project) - 2024-08-01

**Context:** Brainstorming identified tight coupling between `Main.setGridParams` and `UiManager.newGridUi.updateUIState`.

**Decision:** Implement a simple Pub/Sub event system using a singleton `eventBus` (`util/eventManager.js`) to decouple components.

**Initial Implementation:** Refactor the Grid UI update flow:

1. `Main.setGridParams` will now emit a `gridParamsUpdated` event instead of calling the UI update directly.
2. `UiManager` will subscribe to `gridParamsUpdated` during initialization and trigger `newGridUi.updateUIState` when the event is received.

**Plan Reference:** See `memoryBank/plan.md` for detailed implementation steps.

---

## Event System Refactoring (Grid Project) - 2024-08-03

**Objective:** Implement the refined two-event system (`uiControlChanged` -> `gridParamsUpdated`) to decouple components and centralize state management in `Main`.

**Execution Log:**

1.  **`NewGridUi`:** Modified all controls (`onChange` handlers) to emit `eventBus.emit('uiControlChanged', { paramPath, value })` instead of calling `main.setGridParams` or the old `onChangeCallback`. Removed `onChangeCallback` property and `setOnChangeCallback` method.
2.  **`UiManager`:** Removed unused `onChangeCallback` property.
3.  **`Main`:**
    - Removed old callback registration for `NewGridUi`.
    - Subscribed to `uiControlChanged` event, routing it to `handleGridUIChange`.
    - Updated `handleGridUIChange` signature to destructure payload: `({ paramPath, value })`.
    - Modified `setGridParams` to remove direct calls to `boundaryManager.update`, `boundaryRenderer.update`, `gridRender.setGrid`.
    - Modified `setGridParams` to emit `gridParamsUpdated` with payload `{ gridParams, dimensions }`.
4.  **`BoundaryManager`:** Subscribed to `gridParamsUpdated` in constructor, calling `this.update(gridParams, dimensions)` using the event payload.
5.  **`BoundaryRenderer`:**
    - Modified constructor to accept and store `boundaryManager` and `canvas` dependencies.
    - Updated `Main` to instantiate `BoundaryRenderer` _after_ `BoundaryManager` and pass the dependencies.
    - Subscribed to `gridParamsUpdated` in constructor, calling `this.update` using stored dependencies and event payload.
6.  **`GridGenRenderer`:**
    - Modified constructor to accept and store `dimensionManager` and `boundaryManager` dependencies.
    - Updated `Main` to instantiate `GridGenRenderer` and pass the manager dependencies.
    - Subscribed to `gridParamsUpdated` in constructor, calling `this.setGrid` using stored dependencies and event payload.
7.  **`UiManager`:** Updated existing `gridParamsUpdated` subscription handler to destructure the event payload `({ gridParams })`.

**Status:** Core event flow refactoring complete. UI changes now emit `uiControlChanged`, `Main` updates state and emits `gridParamsUpdated`, and relevant components (`UiManager`, `BoundaryManager`, `BoundaryRenderer`, `GridGenRenderer`) subscribe to `gridParamsUpdated` to trigger their respective updates.

## Fix `lil-gui` Error in Boundary UI (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Context:** After refactoring the boundary scale control, the application failed to initialize with a `lil-gui.esm.min.js:8 gui.add failed property: scale` error.

**Analysis:** The error log confirmed that `boundaryUi.js` was correctly trying to bind the "B-Scale" slider to `this.main.simParams.boundary`. However, the target object (`simParams.boundary`) lacked the required `scale` property, causing `gui.add()` to fail.

**Fix:** Added the missing `scale: 1.0,` property definition to the `this.simParams.boundary` object within `Sim/src/main.js`.

**Result:** The UI can now successfully initialize the boundary scale slider, binding it to the newly defined property in `simParams`.

---

## Optimize Boundary Updates for Non-Visual Changes (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Context:** Noticed in logs that changes to physics-only boundary parameters (restitution, damping, repulsion, mode) or scale changes when the boundary wasn't visible were triggering unnecessary recalculations and potential DOM updates in `BoundaryManager` and `BoundaryRenderer`.

**Analysis:** Both `BoundaryManager` and `BoundaryRenderer` were subscribed to the general `simParamsUpdated` event and performed their full update routines regardless of which specific parameter changed.

**Optimization:**

1.  **`BoundaryManager`:**
    - Modified the `simParamsUpdated` handler (`updateSimParams`) to track the previous `scale` value.
    - It now only calls `_updateBoundaries` (which recalculates shape/size) if the `scale` value has actually changed.
    - Physics-only properties (damping, restitution, etc.) are now applied directly to the `this.physicsBoundary` object if they change, without triggering the more expensive `_updateBoundaries`.
2.  **`BoundaryRenderer`:**
    - Modified the `simParamsUpdated` handler to track the previous `scale` and `showBoundary` flag values.
    - It now only calls its `update` method (which manipulates the DOM element) if either the `scale` or the `showBoundary` flag has changed.

**Result:** Boundary updates are now more efficient. Changes to non-visual physics parameters only update the necessary properties on the `physicsBoundary` object used by the simulation, without triggering geometry recalculations or DOM updates. Visual updates only occur when the scale changes or the visibility flag is toggled.

---

## GridGenRenderer Dynamic Coloring Integration (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective:** Enable `GridGenRenderer` to display dynamic colors based on simulation data calculated by `GridRenderModes`, running concurrently with the isolated legacy `GridRenderer` pipeline.

**Execution Log:**

1.  **Dependencies:** Modified `GridGenRenderer` constructor to accept `particleSystem` dependency and instantiate `GridRenderModes`. Removed unused `socketManager` import/instantiation. Kept `Gradient` instantiation as it's needed for color mapping in the new `draw` method.
2.  **Initialization:** Updated `main.js` to pass `particleSystem` during `GridGenRenderer` instantiation.
3.  **Grid Map Handling:** Added `createGridMap` helper to `GridGenRenderer`. Updated `updateGridGeometryAndRender` to create/update the internal `gridMap` and notify `renderModes` instance via `renderModes.updateGrid`.
4.  **Color Calculation:** Modified `GridGenRenderer.prepareInstanceData` to remove the uniform color parameter and instead calculate per-instance color based on data retrieved from `this.renderModes.getValues()`. Used a placeholder grayscale mapping for initial implementation.
5.  **Per-Frame Drawing:** Added a `draw()` method to `GridGenRenderer`. This method gets latest data from `renderModes`, uses the `Gradient` instance to map normalized data values to colors, updates the instance color buffer on the GPU via `bufferSubData`, and calls `renderCellsInstanced` to draw.
6.  **Concurrency:** Added `this.gridGenRenderer.draw()` call to the main `render()` loop in `main.js`, placed _before_ the legacy `this.gridRenderer.draw()` call.

**Status:** `GridGenRenderer` is now integrated with `GridRenderModes` and updates its cell colors each frame based on simulation data, drawing concurrently with the legacy `GridRenderer`. Placeholder color mapping is used; needs refinement (normalization, gradient selection). Legacy pipeline remains isolated.

## Legacy GridRenderer Fix (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Issue:** After integrating `GridGenRenderer.draw()` into the main render loop before `GridRenderer.draw()`, the legacy renderer stopped working.

**Analysis:** Determined the cause was WebGL state interference. `GridGenRenderer` uses instanced drawing, enabling multiple vertex attributes (`position`, `instanceMatrix`, `instanceColor`, `instanceShadowParams`). `GridRenderer` uses non-instanced drawing and only expects the `position` attribute to be enabled. The attributes enabled by `GridGenRenderer` were persisting and causing issues for `GridRenderer`.

**Fix:** Modified `GridGenRenderer.renderCellsInstanced()` to disable all vertex attribute arrays it uses immediately after its `gl.drawArraysInstanced` call. This cleans up the GL state, preventing interference with the subsequent legacy `GridRenderer` draw calls.

**Status:** The legacy `GridRenderer` should now function correctly alongside the concurrently drawing `GridGenRenderer`.

## Fix GridGenRenderer Visibility (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Issue:** `GridGenRenderer` output was not visible despite being called in the render loop, and its UI toggle had no effect.

**Analysis:** The legacy `GridRenderer.draw()` method contained a `gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)` call. Since it runs _after_ `GridGenRenderer.draw()`, it was erasing the output of the new renderer every frame.

**Fix:** Commented out the `gl.clearColor` and `gl.clear` calls within `GridRenderer.draw()`. This allows the output of `GridGenRenderer` (drawn first) to persist on the canvas underneath the legacy renderer's output.

**Status:** Both renderers should now be visible concurrently. The UI toggle for `GridGenRenderer`'s visibility (`gridParams.flags.showGridCells`) should now have a visible effect.

## Add Diagnostics to GridGenRenderer (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Issue:** `GridGenRenderer` grid is not displaying, even after ensuring the legacy renderer doesn't clear the canvas.

**Action:** Added `console.log` statements to `GridGenRenderer.draw()` and `GridGenRenderer.renderCellsInstanced()` to track execution flow, the value of the `showGridCells` flag, and the instance count being drawn.

**Purpose:** To determine if the renderer is being skipped due to the flag, attempting to draw zero instances, or if the draw call itself isn't happening as expected.

## Test GridGenRenderer Visibility vs Particles (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Issue:** `GridGenRenderer` grid is not displaying, despite logs confirming its draw calls execute with correct flags and instance counts.

**Hypothesis:** The `ParticleRenderer`, which runs last, might be drawing particles (even semi-transparent ones) over the `GridGenRenderer` output, obscuring it.

**Test:** Temporarily commented out the `this.particleRenderer.draw(...)` call in `main.js` render loop.

**Expected Result:** If the hypothesis is correct, the `GridGenRenderer` grid should now become visible.

## Debug GridGenRenderer Visibility (Index Gradient Test) (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Issue:** `GridGenRenderer` grid visible with fixed color, confirming core drawing works, but not with dynamic color from `GridRenderModes`.

**Action:** Modified `GridGenRenderer.draw()` to color cells based on their instance index mapped through the `Gradient` object. This bypasses `GridRenderModes` data but tests the gradient lookup and color buffer update.

**Purpose:** To further isolate the problem. If this works, the issue lies specifically in how data from `GridRenderModes` is obtained or normalized before gradient lookup. If this fails, the issue might be in the gradient lookup/buffer update itself.

**Expected Result:** A grid displaying a smooth color transition based on cell index according to the active gradient.

## Refactor GridGenRenderer Coloring (Index Gradient Default) (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Action:** Moved the index-based gradient coloring logic from the temporary `draw()` method implementation into the `prepareInstanceData()` method. This ensures that the instance color buffer is populated with the index-based gradient colors whenever the grid geometry is generated or updated.

**Result:** The `draw()` method was simplified to only contain checks and the call to `renderCellsInstanced()`, as the color data is now prepared beforehand.

**Status:** `GridGenRenderer` now defaults to rendering the grid with colors determined by mapping the instance index through the active gradient. This provides a baseline visualization while isolating the `GridRenderModes` data integration for future steps.
