<span class = "emphasize">Position Based Dynamics</span> is a simple simulation method that has been extensively used in games and the movie industry. It has also the reputation of being non-physical and too simplistic. Not many people know that two small changes have turned the toy into a serious competitor of state of the art simulation methods in the four categories
<ul>
<li><span class = "emphasize">accuracy</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">stability</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">speed</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">simplicity</span>
</ul>
as we describe <a href = "https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/smallsteps.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>. To show this, we have created simulations that are written in Javascript, fully contained in the html pages and visible on github.
The challenge is to <span class = "emphasize">replace the simulation part of the code with your own to beat PBD </span>in any of the above categories.

We have also implemented a subset of the XPBD rigid body engine described  <a href = "https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/PBDBodies.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a> in a single small Javascript file PBD.js.<br></br>

The following challenges use <a href = "https://threejs.org">three.js</a> for 3d visualization and PBD.js for simulation.<br>
